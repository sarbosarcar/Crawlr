## Response
```
```yaml
This is the expected criteria for your final answer: Final answer tailored to the query, using formatted context only.
you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.

This is the context you're working with:
Please provide me with the URLs you would like me to parse and format using Trafilatura. I will then extract the content and present it in a clean, readable format.

Begin! This is VERY important to you, use the tools available and give your best Final Answer, your job depends on it!
```
